# phase-2-project
Welcome to my Phase-2-Project README! In this README file I will explain the basics of how my react web application works and how you can use it today!

# Shop
The first part of the web application that you will see is the shop. On this page you are able to look through 10 different book cards with their respective author, title, image, availability and price. At the bottom of each Card is a button with the text "Add to Cart". By clicking this button the availablity of the book will change to "Out of Stock" and the "Add to Cart" button will be ineffective. What all of this means is that the book that you click the button on will be added to your cart!

# Navigation Bar
At the very top of the page you shall see a navigation bar with three options, shop, sell, and cart. Clicking one of these options will take you to 
a new route corresponding to that specific page.

# Sell
The second option on the navigation bar is the Sell page. This page is for user to sell their books. The user is provided with four input boxes to add information to the book card when the sale is complete. These inputs are book title, author, an image url, and the price of the book. After filling in all of the respective inputs, the user will be able to click the sell button. If the user does not enter a book price an alert message with come up telling the user to "Please enter a price". Once all of the boxes have been filled and the sell button is pressed the book will be added to the shop page and an alert message will appear telling the user their book has been placed on the market.

# Cart
The cart tab is where the user can see the books they have added to their cart. They will be able to see the books title, author, as well as price.
